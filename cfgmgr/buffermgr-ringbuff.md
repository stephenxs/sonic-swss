# Buffer Manager Ring Buffer Integration

## Background

### Initial Problem
The original code in `orch.cpp` had a hardcoded check that only enabled ring buffer for a single table:
```cpp
if (gRingBuffer && executor->getName() == APP_ROUTE_TABLE_NAME) {
    gRingBuffer->addExecutor(executor);
}
```

This approach was not scalable as it required code changes to add new tables to ring buffer processing.

### Ring Buffer Architecture
- **Ring Buffer**: A mechanism introduced to accelerate the process of receiving updates from Redis databases by buffering tasks
- **Orch Class**: Core class responsible for receiving updates from Redis databases and dispatching them to handlers
- **Executor Class**: Represents an entity that performs tasks, managed by the Orch class
- **OrchDaemon**: The main daemon of orchagent that uses the Orch class and ring buffer
- **Buffer Manager Daemon (buffermgrd)**: Another daemon that shares infrastructure with orchdaemon but initially did not use ring buffer

### Key Components
- `std::shared_ptr<RingBuffer> gRingBuffer`: Global shared pointer managing the RingBuffer instance
- `Consumer` and `SubscriberStateTable`/`ConsumerStateTable`: Classes involved in consuming data from Redis tables
- `APP_ROUTE_TABLE_NAME` and other `APP_*_TABLE_NAME` macros: Specific table names used for Redis operations

## Requirements

### Phase 1: Scalable Ring Buffer Check
1. Replace the hardcoded executor name check with a scalable set-based approach
2. Extend the set to include buffer-related tables for future scalability

### Phase 2: Buffer Manager Ring Buffer Integration
1. Add a member in Orch class representing whether ring buffer is default for all tables (false by default)
2. Add a member function to modify this setting
3. Make buffer manager daemon create ring buffer by default
4. Make buffer manager daemon call the new function to add all its executors to ring buffer
5. Add CLI option "r" to control whether ring buffer should be used
6. Implement the same ring buffer logic from orchdaemon in buffermgrd

### Design Goals
- Avoid function overloading in Orch class
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Maintain consistency with orchdaemon implementation
- Provide optional ring buffer functionality via CLI

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Scalable Ring Buffer Check

#### Files Modified: `src/sonic-swss/orchagent/orch.cpp`

**Changes Made:**
1. Replaced hardcoded check with set-based lookup:
```cpp
// Define the set of table names that should be served by the ring buffer
static const std::set<std::string> ringBufferServedTables = {
    APP_ROUTE_TABLE_NAME,
    APP_BUFFER_POOL_TABLE_NAME,
    APP_BUFFER_PROFILE_TABLE_NAME,
    APP_BUFFER_PG_TABLE_NAME,
    APP_BUFFER_QUEUE_TABLE_NAME,
    APP_BUFFER_PORT_INGRESS_PROFILE_LIST_NAME,
    APP_BUFFER_PORT_EGRESS_PROFILE_LIST_NAME
    // Add more table names here as needed for scalability
};

if (gRingBuffer && ringBufferServedTables.find(executor->getName()) != ringBufferServedTables.end()) {
    gRingBuffer->addExecutor(executor);
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Scalable: Easy to add new tables by updating the set
- Maintainable: No code changes required for new table additions
- Future-proof: Buffer-related tables already included for buffer manager integration

### Phase 2: Buffer Manager Ring Buffer Integration

#### Files Modified: `src/sonic-swss/orchagent/orch.h`

**Changes Made:**
1. Added public member function:
```cpp
void setRingBufferDefault(bool enabled);
```

2. Added private member variable:
```cpp
bool m_ringBufferDefault = false;
```

3. Modified `addExecutor` logic to use the flag:
```cpp
if (gRingBuffer && (m_ringBufferDefault || ringBufferServedTables.find(executor->getName()) != ringBufferServedTables.end())) {
    gRingBuffer->addExecutor(executor);
}
```

**Access Control Fix:**
- Initially placed `setRingBufferDefault` in protected section, causing compilation error
- Moved to public section to allow access from buffermgrd.cpp
- Kept other functions in their original access levels

#### Files Modified: `src/sonic-swss/cfgmgr/buffermgrd.cpp`

**Changes Made:**

1. **Added includes and global variables:**
```cpp
#include <thread>

// Global ring buffer and thread for buffermgrd
std::shared_ptr<RingBuffer> gRingBuffer = nullptr;
std::thread gRingThread;
bool gUseRingBuffer = false;
```

2. **Added CLI option "r":**
```cpp
// Updated usage function
cout << "       -r: Enable ring buffer for improved performance (optional)" << endl;

// Updated getopt string
while ((opt = getopt(argc, argv, "l:a:p:z:r:h")) != -1 )

// Added case handler
case 'r':
    gUseRingBuffer = true;
    break;
```

3. **Added popRingBuffer function (identical to orchdaemon):**
```cpp
void popRingBuffer()
{
    SWSS_LOG_ENTER();

    // make sure there is only one thread created to run popRingBuffer()
    if (!gRingBuffer || gRingBuffer->thread_created)
        return;

    gRingBuffer->thread_created = true;
    SWSS_LOG_NOTICE("buffermgrd starts the popRingBuffer thread!");

    while (!gRingBuffer->thread_exited)
    {
        gRingBuffer->pauseThread();

        gRingBuffer->setIdle(false);

        AnyTask func;
        while (gRingBuffer->pop(func)) {
            func();
        }

        gRingBuffer->setIdle(true);
    }
}
```

4. **Conditional ring buffer creation in static mode:**
```cpp
auto buffermgr = new BufferMgr(&cfgDb, &applDb, pg_lookup_file, cfg_buffer_tables);
cfgOrchList.emplace_back(buffermgr);

// Create ring buffer if enabled via CLI option
if (gUseRingBuffer) {
    gRingBuffer = std::make_shared<RingBuffer>();
    Executor::gRingBuffer = gRingBuffer;
    Orch::gRingBuffer = gRingBuffer;
    SWSS_LOG_NOTICE("RingBuffer created for buffermgrd at %p!", (void *)gRingBuffer.get());
    
    // Enable ring buffer for all tables in BufferMgr
    buffermgr->setRingBufferDefault(true);
    
    // Start the ring buffer thread
    gRingThread = std::thread(popRingBuffer);
}
```

5. **Enhanced Select::TIMEOUT branch with ring buffer logic:**
```cpp
if (ret == Select::TIMEOUT)
{
    if (gUseRingBuffer && gRingBuffer)
    {
        if (!gRingBuffer->IsEmpty() || !gRingBuffer->IsIdle())
        {
            gRingBuffer->notify();
        }
        else
        {
            buffmgr->doTask();
        }
    }
    else
    {
        buffmgr->doTask();
    }
    continue;
}
```

6. **Enhanced post-execution logic:**
```cpp
auto *c = (Executor *)sel;
c->execute();

/* After each iteration, periodically check all m_toSync map to
 * execute all the remaining tasks that need to be retried. */
if (!gUseRingBuffer || !gRingBuffer || (gRingBuffer->IsEmpty() && gRingBuffer->IsIdle()))
{
    buffmgr->doTask();
}
```

7. **Added cleanup logic:**
```cpp
// Cleanup ring buffer thread
if (gUseRingBuffer && gRingBuffer) {
    gRingBuffer->thread_exited = true;
    gRingBuffer->notify();
}

if (gUseRingBuffer && gRingThread.joinable()) {
    gRingThread.join();
}
```

#### Files Modified: `src/sonic-swss/cfgmgr/buffermgr.cpp`

**Changes Made:**
- **Completely reverted to original state** - no ring buffer modifications
- Removed any previously added ring buffer functionality
- Kept the class focused on its core buffer management responsibilities

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Centralized Ring Buffer Management
- Ring buffer creation and management moved to daemon level (buffermgrd.cpp)
- Follows the same pattern as orchdaemon.cpp
- BufferMgr class remains unchanged and focused on core functionality

### 2. Optional Feature via CLI
- Ring buffer is an optional feature controlled by `-r` CLI flag
- Provides flexibility for different deployment scenarios
- Maintains backward compatibility

### 3. Consistent with OrchDaemon
- Uses identical ring buffer logic and patterns
- Same thread management approach
- Same timeout and post-execution handling

### 4. Clean Separation of Concerns
- Orch class: Core orchestration logic with configurable ring buffer behavior
- BufferMgr class: Pure buffer management functionality
- buffermgrd: Daemon-level infrastructure and ring buffer management

## Usage Examples

### Without Ring Buffer (Default)
```bash
buffermgrd -l pg_lookup.ini
```

### With Ring Buffer Enabled
```bash
buffermgrd -l pg_lookup.ini -r
```

### With Ring Buffer and Other Options
```bash
buffermgrd -l pg_lookup.ini -r -p peripheral_table.json
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Scalability
- Easy to add new tables to ring buffer processing
- No code changes required for table additions
- Set-based approach provides clear visibility of supported tables

### 2. Performance
- Buffer manager daemon can leverage ring buffer for accelerated processing
- Consistent performance improvements across all supported tables
- Background thread processing reduces main thread blocking

### 3. Flexibility
- Optional ring buffer functionality via CLI
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Allows performance tuning based on deployment needs

### 4. Maintainability
- Clean separation of concerns
- Consistent patterns with existing orchdaemon
- Minimal changes to existing codebase

## Technical Notes

### Ring Buffer Thread Lifecycle
1. **Creation**: When `-r` flag is used, ring buffer is created and thread started
2. **Processing**: Thread continuously processes tasks from ring buffer
3. **Cleanup**: Thread is properly signaled to exit and joined during daemon shutdown

### Task Processing Priority
1. **Ring Buffer Active**: Tasks are processed by ring buffer thread
2. **Ring Buffer Idle**: Tasks are processed directly by main thread
3. **Ring Buffer Disabled**: All tasks processed directly (original behavior)

### Error Handling
- Proper thread cleanup prevents resource leaks
- Conditional logic prevents operations on non-existent ring buffer
- Graceful fallback to direct processing when ring buffer is unavailable

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Dynamic Ring Buffer Configuration**: Runtime enable/disable without restart
2. **Table-Specific Ring Buffer**: Different ring buffers for different table types
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Metrics for ring buffer utilization and performance
4. **Configuration File Support**: Ring buffer settings via configuration files

### Maintenance
- Monitor ring buffer performance in production deployments
- Consider expanding table set based on usage patterns
- Evaluate need for additional CLI options for fine-tuning
